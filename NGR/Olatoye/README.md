# Olatoye dataset
This dataset comes from the G3 paper: [Genomic Signatures of Adaptation to a Precipitation Gradient in Nigerian Sorghum](http://www.g3journal.org/content/ggg/8/10/3269.full.pdf). The study uses a panel of 607 West African sorghum accessions and 400,000 SNPs to find QTL associated with local adaptation. The dataset contains the SNP information, the phenotypic data (flowering time, panicle length, and plant height) comes from passport data (publically submitted phenotypes) from the USDA GRIN database. All this information is in the RDS file. See the .R file to see how the data was compiled.
