# Lasky 2016
This is a dataset from Jesse Lasky's 2016 [paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1755-0998.12714) that describes an approach to synthesize data from common garden and genomeâ€“environment associations to infer SNP effects for local adaptation. The paper uses data from [Fournier-Level et al 2011](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/334/6052/86), [Handcock et al (2012)](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/334/6052/83), and [Horton et al (2012)](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.1042). I have taken these data and selected accessions that have phenotypic information, climate data at their collection sites, and genotypic data. The .Rds file contains all these data. 
SNPs were obtained from [here](http://bergelson.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/call_method_75.tar.gz)
Phenotypic and climate data were accessed from [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1755-0998.12714)
