This is an unpublished dataset. Brefily, 357 accessions from RDP1 were phenotyped for salinity tolerance (12 mM NaCl). The experiment follows a very similar design as described in [Campbell et al (2015)](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/168/4/1476). However, in this study the plants were phenotyped during the active tillering stage (~20 days after transplant). The RDS file contains a list with elements for the phenotypic data (PSA), the genotypic data for 44k data and 700k data. Note that the genotyic data contains missing information and has not been filtered for MAF.
